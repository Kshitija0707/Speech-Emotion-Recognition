# Speech Emotion Recognition Using LSTM

## Introduction
This project aims to recognize emotions in speech using deep learning with LSTM networks. It extracts MFCC features from audio data and trains a model to classify emotions like happy, sad, angry, etc.

## Features
- Extracts MFCC features from speech.
- Trains an LSTM model for emotion classification.
- Evaluates model accuracy and performance.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Example
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the entire process of training and evaluating the model.
